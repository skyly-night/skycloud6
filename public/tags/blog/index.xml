      <description>I was thinking of creating a blog since quite a while. I want to express who I am and share my ideas with other people. So, I guess the internet is just the perfect place to do so :)
Soo, to get started, I think that I&amp;rsquo;m going to talk a lot about my thoughts, quite a lot of philosophy probably and anything else that means something to me. This is kind of a dream coming true right now, and who knows where I&amp;rsquo;ll end up on this journey!</description>

&lt;p&gt;I think this will be a lot of fun, and I made my GitHub-Repository public, so you can go and comment on there, what I could do next, or share your own ideas with me!&lt;/p&gt;
